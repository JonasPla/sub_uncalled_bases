# Substitute uncalled bases
This script changes unassigned nucleotides (N) from one seq
uence in an alignment and substitutes them by the nucleotides from another seque
nce. This is useful if two sequences are highly similar but one has a lot of unc
alled bases. The assumption is that the true state of these uncalled bases is al
so highly similar to the other sequence.
